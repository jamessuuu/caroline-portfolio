### THE PROMPT

```
Design a single-page portfolio website hero section and one content section
for a Filipino Virtual Assistant named Caroline Eduardo. This is the design
basis - establish the visual language, typography, color, and component style
that the rest of the site will follow.

BRAND PERSONALITY:
- Professional but warm. Not corporate-cold, not bubbly-casual.
- Confident and competent. She has 4+ years of real admin/HR experience.
- Modern and tech-forward. She uses AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT.
- Approachable. Overseas clients should feel "I want to work with her."
- Human. This should NOT look AI-generated or template-generic.

COLOR PALETTE:
- Background: Deep dark navy/charcoal (#0A0A0F to #13131A)
- Primary accent: Warm gold (#D4A853) - signals reliability, professionalism
- Secondary accent: Soft violet/purple (#7C6AC8) - signals tech/AI/creativity
- Text: Off-white (#F5F5F5) primary, muted gray (#9CA3AF) secondary
- Success/metrics: Soft green (#4ADE80) for stats and numbers
- Subtle gradients blending gold and violet for backgrounds and glows

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headlines: Bold geometric sans-serif (like Cabinet Grotesk, Clash Display,
  or Satoshi). Large, confident, slightly tight letter-spacing.
- Body: Clean readable sans-serif (Inter or similar). 16-18px base.
- Accent text: Monospace or condensed for labels, tags, stats.

DESIGN ELEMENTS TO ESTABLISH:

1. HERO SECTION (above the fold):
   - Large animated headline: "Your Next Reliable Virtual Assistant"
   - Subtitle: "AI-Augmented Admin Professional | 4+ Years Experience |
     Philippines"
   - Two CTA buttons: "Download Resume" (outlined) and "Let's Work Together"
     (filled gold)
   - Stats row: "4+ Years Experience" / "99% Accuracy" / "100+ Records Managed"
   - Background: subtle gradient orbs (gold and purple, blurred) floating
     behind content
   - Optional: small professional headshot circle or silhouette placeholder

2. SERVICES SECTION (bento grid):
   - Section title: "How I Can Help You"
   - 6-8 cards in an asymmetric bento grid layout (mix of large and small cards)
   - Cards have glassmorphism style: semi-transparent dark surface, subtle
     border, backdrop blur
   - Each card: icon + service title + 3 specific tasks listed
   - Services to show:
     * Admin & Email Management (large card)
     * HR & Documentation Support
     * AI-Powered Research & Content
     * Customer Service & Client Relations
     * Calendar & Scheduling
     * Data Entry & Records Management
     * Social Media Support
     * Travel & Event Coordination
   - Hover state: card lifts slightly, border glows with accent color

LAYOUT STYLE:
- Wide layout, max-width ~1200px centered
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Content left-aligned or center-aligned (not justified)
- Mobile-responsive considerations visible

MOOD/REFERENCES:
- Think: Linear.app landing page meets a personal portfolio
- Clean like Vercel's design language
- Warm like a boutique consultancy site
- NOT: generic Canva template, Wix template, overly decorative

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Stock photo backgrounds
- Rounded bubbly shapes (keep it sharp and modern)
- Overly bright or neon colors
- Busy patterns or textures
- Generic VA clipart or illustrations
- Anything that looks like a 2020 template

## FOR PENCIL (.pen) DESIGN TOOL

If using the Pencil MCP tool in this project, ask me to:
"Create the hero section and services bento grid in a .pen file using
the design basis above"

And I'll translate this into actual Pencil MCP operations with exact
node structures, colors, and layouts.
